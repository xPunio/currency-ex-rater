# Simple currency exchange app

## Summary
This project is simple app that I made to have something useful for me made by myself because I like to check daily exchange rates due to personal interest in investing.

## Tech Stack
To made this project I used Vite template for React + Typescript app. Whole reactivity is done using react. On top of that charts are generated using special Recharts (special library that allows to draw charts using react). Due to small UI there is no a lot of responsive design patterns - only mostly needed changes that allow to use application on smaller screens.
